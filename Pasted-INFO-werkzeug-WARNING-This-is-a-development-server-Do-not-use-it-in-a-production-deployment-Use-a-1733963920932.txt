Introduction\n\n* "Today I will be talking about the six ways you perhaps have, but most of you haven\'t, exited the Matrix."\n* "The reason why I\'m talking about this today is because on the heels of my law Workshop, \'It\'s Not Your Duty to Pay,\' I have opened up the True Living Membership, which is a fellowship platform that has a community to support these six ways that I\'m going to talk about today."\n\nII. Spirituality\n\n* "Through spiritual development and growth and seeking and inquiry, I realized that there were three main aspects that were critical for me to embrace in order to be able to live a life of truth and freedom beyond what the Matrix provides."\n* "These are one, having meaning in life; two, having fellowship; and three, embarking on a path of personal growth and development."\n* "Without making a commitment to developing ourselves, we subject ourselves to stagnation, to a life of repeating the same mistakes over and over."\n\nIII. Autodidactism\n\n* "One of the ways to exit the Matrix is to learn to become autodidacts, where we don\'t have to rely on others to spoon-feed us information, but we can go out into any area that we wish to learn about and independently find the right sources of information or skills or training that are out there."\n* "Without this ability, we are subjected and vulnerable to false paradigms and false narratives."\n\nIV. Family and Relationships\n\n* "The current rates of divorce and the disintegration of the so-called nuclear family are a serious problem."\n* "Part of it actually has to do with the laws around marriage that are built into the system and what it means to undergo that."\n* "We need to look at how family and relationship has been altered by dark agendas so that we can have a healthy relationship and avoid the divorce trap and raise excellent children who will carry on this tradition."\n\nV. Health and Science\n\n* "Diabetes has become a major, major issue in the modern era."\n* "If we go back to the statistics about how many people had diabetes in the 1800s, you\'ll see it was a very rare condition."\n* "With the right support and the right knowledge, you could in three weeks rid yourself of diabetes forever."\n* "This is exactly the kind of thing that keeps you weak, vulnerable, and dependent, so that you stay in the Matrix."\n\nVI. Connection to Nature\n\n* "We live in artificial environments, we focus on convenience or prefer convenience to doing things in a more natural, balanced, and harmonious way in our world."\n* "As a result of this, we have stopped observing the natural cycles and we\'re out of touch with how things go."\n* "Reestablishing this connection to nature is critical to keep you outside of the traps of the Matrix."\n\nVII. Self-Governance\n\n* "This involves, in a sense, exerting your own sovereignty over your life, not allowing yourself to be pawned or controlled or being something that you\'re not."\n* "The root of this is knowing actually what your real role is, both as a man or a woman in the private, versus who you are out there in the commercial and legal fiction world."\n* "If we don\'t realize that we are actually not some dead fictional entity, we are operating that dead fictional entity like a business, we basically all are, have our own business, we just don\'t really know about it because we haven\'t figured out that it\'s not that we\'re getting screwed over all the time, it\'s that we don\'t really know what we\'re supposed to do."\n\nVIII. Conclusion\n\n* "The six ways that you are stuck in the Matrix if you don\'t develop yourself and in the True Living Fellowship, we call these the six pillars."\n* "I want you to work on these things and make that commitment to your own personal growth and development if you haven\'t already."\n* "I look forward to seeing everyone next week for another Healthy Living live stream."', 'tool_calls': []}, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'stop_reason': None}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 7260, 'total_tokens': 8122, 'completion_tokens': 862}, 'prompt_logprobs': None}
